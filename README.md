# til

A place to capture/share small scoped learnings in my day-to-day.

Currently not a daily occurrence, as [daily-go](https://github.com/anyu/daily-go) is the habit I'm focused on.

## Motivations

#### 1. Learn (more) in public

- Solidifies my own understanding while having the potential to be useful to others
- Improves my technical articulation

#### 2. Learn "along the way"

So much of our learning happens during the course of everyday work. There's so much opportunity to capture them more than I've been doing.
Taking 15mins out of my day "along the way", while the learning is fresh, will compound and be more sustainable longterm.
