# TIL - test

Today I learned.
A place to capture/share learnings from my day-to-day. These may be higher-level concepts or bite-sized how to's.

Inspired by [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).

## Motivations

#### 1. Learn (more) in public

- Solidifies my own understanding while having the potential to be useful to others
- Improves my technical articulation

#### 2. Learn "along the way"

So much of our learning happens during the course of everyday work. There's so much opportunity to capture them more than I've been doing.
Taking 15mins out of my day "along the way", while the learning is fresh, will compound and be more sustainable longterm.
