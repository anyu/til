# AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS)

A distributed pub/sub system. 

- Messages are pushed to subscribers.
- Distributes several copies of messages to several subscribers. 
  eg. You want to replicate data generated by an application to several storage systems. You could use SNS and send this data to multiple subscribers, each replicating the messages it receives to different storage systems (S3, hard disk on your host, database, etc.).
- Use case: Fanout - processing the same message in multiple ways

Often used with SQS.
