# Deno

- created to address perceived shortcomings of Node.js (security, module management) 
- has built-in TypeScript support
- uses sandboxing to secure runtime environment (your code cannot access files or networks w/o permissions)
- built in Rust, runs on top of V8
- cons: less mature, limited 3rd party libs
