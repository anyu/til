# Overview of JS Engines

A JS Engine is a program that translates source code into machine code and executes it on a computer.

The engine can be thought of as a container in which you run your code.

The engine works inside a JS runtime environment, which allow the engine to communicate with the outside world.

Examples of JS engines:
- V8, used in Chrome, Opera
- SpiderMonkey, used in Firefox
- Nitro, used in Safari
- Chakra, used in Microsoft's Edge browser
