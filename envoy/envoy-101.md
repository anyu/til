> An opensource edge and service proxy.

Comparable to NGINX, HAProxy

## Overview

- Uses sidecar proxy pattern
- Runs alongside every application and abstracts the network component

## Compared to NGINX, HAProxy

- NGINX's business model creates tension between its commercial product and its OSS offering
- HAProxy has less forward community/velocity
- Envoy (released in 2016) was designed from the start for microservices
