# React

## React Hooks
React 16.8 introduced Hooks, enabling using state without a separate class.

### Rules of Hooks
- Only call Hooks at the top level in the body of a function component or custom Hook, before early returns.
- Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions, nested functions
  - This ensures that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders, which lets React correctively preserve state of Hooks between multiple `useState` and `useEffect` calls
  - If needed, extract a new component and move the state into it.
- Only Call Hooks from React funcs, not JS funs

### State Hooks
- [useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState): the first tool to reach for for simple local state

  ```js
  import { useState } from "react";

  function Layout() {
    const [isSidebarOpen, setSidebarOpen] = useState(false);

    return (
      <>
        <Sidebar isSidebarOpen={isSidebarOpen} closeSidebar={() => setSidebarOpen(false)} />
        {/* ... */}
      </>
    );
  ```
- [useReducer](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer#reference): Similar to `useState` but instead of an initial state, it accepts a reducer function (function that specifies how the state gets updated. Takes in the state and action, and returns the next state)
  - The `dispatch` function returned by `useReducer` only updates the state variable for the *next render*. If you read the state variable after calling the dispatch function, you'll still get the old value from before the call.
  - Can be used for local or global state
  - Pros: provides a built-in way to perform different state operations with the help of the reducer function
  - Useful if you have a complicated state that you want to make sure all update logic is in a centralized location
  
    ```js
    const initialState = { votes: 0 };

    function reducer(state, action) {
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'upvote':
          return {votes: state.votes + 1};
        case 'downvote':
          return {votes: state.votes - 1};
        default:
          throw new Error();
      }
    }

    function VoteCounter() {
      const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

      return (
        <>
          Current Votes: {state.votes}
          <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'upvote'})}>Upvote</button>
          <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'downvote'})}>Downvote</button>
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

### Context Hooks
- [useContext](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext): Lets a component receive info from distant parents without passing it as props. A way to avoid prop drilling (when you have to pass down props through intermediate components that don't need it)
- Not technically a state management solution to some
- Good for situations with static data that undergoes lower-frequency updates such as language/time/location prefs, user auth
- Cons: 
  - Default behavior is to re-render all children components if the value provided to it as a prop changes.
  - In many cases you don't want all children to update in response to a global state update (not all children may consume/rely on that state). You only want to re-runder if their props or state changes.
  - Bad practice to combine `useReducer` and `useContext`
- Best practice:
  - Try splitting large context into multiple contexts and keep state close to its component consumer.
- **Note**: In Strict Mode (development-only, not prod), React will call the reducer and initializer twice to help surface accidental impurities. 
  - The result from one of these calls is ignored, so shouldn't affect logic

### Ref Hooks
- [useRef](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef): Lets a component hold some info that isn't used for rendering, like a DOM node or timeout ID.
- Unlike with state, updating a ref does **not** re-render your component. An 'escape hatch' from the Ract paradigm; useful for working with non-React systems, such as brower APIs.

### Effect Hooks
- [useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect): Lets a component connect to and sync with external systems, eg. network calls, DOM, animations, non-React code.
- Another 'escape hatch' from the React paradigm; don't use it to orchestrate data flow.
- If not interacting with an external system, may not need this
- **Note**: React 18 introduced a breaking change. In Strict Mode, all components mount, unmount, then mount again. A `useEffect` with zero deps will be executed twice. In dev, useEffect will fire twice.
  - Workarounds [exist](https://dev.to/ag-grid/react-18-avoiding-use-effect-getting-called-twice-4i9e), but keep in mind, this may break when React releases the [reusable sate](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#new-strict-mode-behaviors) feature

### Performance Hooks

Avoid unnecessary re-rendering and skip calculations:
- [useMemo](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo)
  - Cache result of an expensive calculation
- [useCallback](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback)
  - Cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component

In cases where you can't skip re-rendering, "prioritize rendering". Separate blocking updates that must be synchronous (eg. typing into an input) from non-blocking updates which donâ€™t need to block  UI (eg. updating a chart):
- [useTransition](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition)
  - Update state w/o blocking UI
- [useDeferredValue](https://react.dev/reference/react/useDeferredValue)
  - Defer updating a part of the UI

## State Management

### Local state
- State only used in 1 or other component
- Lifting state up
  - Extracting state from two components to their parent, then passing down via props.
- Methods: State hooks  

### Global state
- State managed across components
- eg. authenticated user state
- Methods: Context hooks, libs below

### State Management Libs

| Name      | Highlights
| :------------- |:-------------
| [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) | - Still the most widely used lib by far. <br/>- Heavy overhead
| [Redux Toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit) | - Simplified, opinionated approach to using Redux. <br/> - Cons: Newer, less support.
| [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) | - Currently the 3rd most popular option after Context, Redux. <br/>- Uses OOP model and an observer/observable pattern. Continually monitors for changes and re-renders as data is manipulated.<br/>- Good community support.
| [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) | -  Perhaps the smallest lib, simple and minimal API based on hooks, fast/scalable. Components don't need to be wrapped in a Context Provider.
| [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) | - Small, cleaner API, good TS support, deeper maturity, very performant due to GC implementation
| [Hookstate](https://github.com/avkonst/hookstate) | - A modern, minimal yet scalable lib. Virtually no boilerplate<br/>- TS-first lib<br/>- Supports plugins<br/>- Unique in how it tracks/updates state<br/>- Cons: Newer lib, so smaller community
| [Recoil](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil) | - Experimental lib form FB<br/>- Uses concepts of atoms/selectors<br/>- Supposedly easier to modify/maintain<br/>- Cons: New, small community, React-dependent
| [Xstate](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate) | - State-machine based lib. Constrains possible states to avoid impossible state situations<br/>- Seems to be good for a very particular use case (when data is modeled in a finite state machine), but less fitting for traditional web uses such as querying a backend.<br/>- Doesn't seem like a complete replacement for other state mgmt solutions.

### Server state
- Data from external servers that must be integrated with UI state
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) and [React Query](https://github.com/tanstack/query) can help with this, since this may be hard to manage alongside local and global UI state.

### URL state
- Data that exists on URLs (eg. path name, query params)

## CSS Management

### CSS Frameworks
- Tailwind
- PureCSS
- Materialize CSS

### CSS-in-JS
- [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
  - Pros: arguably semantically nicer to read
  - Cons: absence of CSS files means you can't cache separate CSS, other libs may not support styled components
    ```js
    import React, { Component } from 'react';
    import styles from 'styled-components';

    const Title = styles.h1`
      padding: 20px;
      background-color: #222;
      text-align: center;
      color: white;
      font-size: 1.5em;
    `;

    class App extends Component {
      render() {
        return (
          <Title>React application title</Title>
        );
      }
    }
    ```
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
  - Pros: Allows integrating with tools like SCSS, less, stylelint, etc; arguably cleaner since it separates styling from code
  - StyleS names using a hash-based on the filename, path, style name
    ```js
    import React, { Component } from 'react';
    import styles from './App.module.css';

    class App extends Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div className={styles.title}>
          React application title
        </div>
      );
    }
    }
    ```
- [Styled JSX](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx)
  ```js
  export default () => (
    <div>
      <p>only this paragraph will get the style</p>

      {/* you can include <Component />'s here that include other <p>s that don't get unexpected styles! */}
      <style jsx>{`
        p {
          color: red;
        }
      `}</style>
    </div>
  )
  ```

### Pre/Post-Processors
- Sass, PostCSS, Less, Stylus

--- 

## Component Management

### React Component Libraries
- [Material UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/): implements Google's Material Design; 
  - Pros: battle-tested, very popularly used
  - Cons: very opinionated, not great for lots of customization
- [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/): official React integration for Semantic UI
  - Cons: Doesn't support internalization, docs not as good
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/): marketed as lib for enterprise products; good for dashboards, admin tools
  - created by Chinese company, so community support may be in Chinese instead

## Optimizing React Performance

### Code-split & lazy load components
-  Split a large bundle file into multiple chunks using dynamic import() followed by lazy loading these chunks on-demand using the React.lazy.
- [React.lazy](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy): Defer loading componentâ€™s code until it is rendered for the first time
  ```js
  const Home = React.lazy(() => import("./components/Home"));
  const About = React.lazy(() => import("./components/About"));
  ```
- [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense): Display a fallback until a component's children have finished loading.Use in conjunction with lazy to specify what should be displayed while it's loading. You can do this by wrapping the lazy component or any of its parents into a <Suspense> boundary:
  ```js
  <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
    <h2>Preview</h2>
    <MarkdownPreview />
  </Suspense>
  ```
  `MarkdownPreview` wonâ€™t be loaded until you attempt to render it; shows Loading component in the meantime.

### Memoize components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Cache a component-rendered operation, save the result in memory, and returns the cached result for the same input.

### Lazy load images, optimize images 
- Wait until image is about to appear in the viewport before rendering in DOM. Prevents the creation of unnecessary DOM nodes.

### Other
- Keep component state local where necessary
- Only fetch data you need 
- Use pagination
- Avoid massive libs, keep bundle small 
- Cache your data with react-query or other lib
- Only put string or number or boolean in useEffect dependencies
- Remove logging in prod
